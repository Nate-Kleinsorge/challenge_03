# Challenge 03

## Description
In challenge three we were tasked with rewriting code to make the website generate and display a password given certain criteria. When you load the page you will be met with a button and a box, press the button to generate a random password. Choose whether or not to include special characters, and then your new password will be displayed to the screen.
